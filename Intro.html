		<p>I am interested in web development not just because I am the front-end developer for my Capstone project, but also because it is important for being a full-stack developer and I believe that it's just an important skill to have in general. I always found web development kinda cool and interesting whenever I see a well designed website.</p>

		<h2>Topics/Skills I would like to learn.</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Decorative Layering for containers.</li>
			<li>Combinning JS, HTML, and CSS to make more professional looking websites.</li>
			<li>Connecting databases to websites to store info.</li>
		</ul>
