      <p class="note">
        I’m a senior Computer Science student at Arkansas Tech University, pursuing a B.S.
        in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. This page is the start of my
        portfolio, where I’ll showcase projects, skills, and coursework as I continue to grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy building software and learning how to design clean, usable websites.
        I’ve worked with C++, C#, Python, SQL, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I’m also developing a project called NextMark, an AI grading aide focused on feedback,
        scoring, and privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of school, I value teamwork and discipline through my experience in the
        Arkansas Army National Guard and leadership experiences. My goal is to keep improving
        my technical skills and build real-world projects that solve problems.
